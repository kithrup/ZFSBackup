Known Issues

* Deciding the list of known snapshots is broken:
  if source has snapshots A, B, and C, but the target
  only has A and C, it will attempt to send an incremental
  backup of B->C.

* Disappearing snapshots are a good and tricky question:
  if a snapshot on source is deleted after generating the
  list of snapshots, then it will fail, since it cannot
  do a send from a non-existent snapshot.  This currently will
  cause the backup to fail, causing another issue, in that
  errors don't propagate to the return value.  (This may not
  be a problem for the API.)

* Process handling needs significant work.  It doesn't detect
  most failures due to the pipeline.

FIXED:

* Multiple processes & threads seem to not work sometimes.  There
  is a deadlock somewhere, resulting from a file descriptor
  remaining open.

* Filters with restore don't work -- I'm using the wrong file
  descriptor/handle in at least one place, and it tries to do
  a read on a write file or vice versa.
  As part of commit 3f96da221a8cd35d38bec6c1d06d613a2ccc1ff5

* Need a way to properly quote command arguments, else whitespace
  in dataset names will break things.  (This impacts ZFSBacupSSH
  only for now.)
