Known Issues

* Deciding the list of known snapshots is broken:
  if source has snapshots A, B, and C, but the target
  only has A and C, it will attempt to send an incremental
  backup of B->C.

* Process handling needs significant work.  It doesn't detect
  most failures due to the pipeline.

* Need a way to properly quote command arguments, else whitespace
  in dataset names will break things.  (This impacts ZFSBacupSSH
  only for now.)

FIXED:

* Multiple processes & threads seem to not work sometimes.  There
  is a deadlock somewhere, resulting from a file descriptor
  remaining open.
  As part of commit 7b397c9ab4ce581938bde67461cb7e1d8f057f70
  
* Filters with restore don't work -- I'm using the wrong file
  descriptor/handle in at least one place, and it tries to do
  a read on a write file or vice versa.
