Known Issues

* Deciding the list of known snapshots is broken:
  if source has snapshots A, B, and C, but the target
  only has A and C, it will attempt to send an incremental
  backup of B->C.

* Process handling needs significant work.  It doesn't detect
  most failures due to the pipeline.

* Multiple processes & threads seem to not work sometimes.  There
  is a deadlock somewhere, resulting from a file descriptor
  remaining open.
