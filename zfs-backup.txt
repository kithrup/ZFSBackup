ZFS Backup Strategy

* Source -> destination
  * Source can be pool or specific dataset
  * Destination must be dataset
  * Hierarchical datasets may need to be created
    * tank/Media/Movies -> backup/tank/Media/Movies needs equivalent of "mkdir -p backup/tank/Media/Movies"
* Requires at least one snapshot
  * Incrementals require at least two snapshots
  * Need to compare snapshots on source and destination
* Can be recursive
  * Recursion should be handled by zfs send -r
  * But could determine by zfs list
    * If done manually, backups need to be done in reverse order
      (e.g., tank/Media/Movies/Marvel, then tank/Media/Movies, etc.)

HOW TO BACKUP

* All backups require at least one snapshot on source.
* Normally or force full
* Normal backup need list of snapshots on source and destination
  * Starting from most recent snapshot, find first snapshot in common.
  * If there is no such snapshot, must be full repliction
  * Otherwise, 'zfs send [-r] -I ${common} ${source}@${latest} |
    	        zfs recv -d -F ${dest}"
* Full backup:  'zfs send [-r] ${source}@${latest} |
       		 zfs recv -d -f ${dest}"
* Can backup specific snapshot, same rules above apply

HOW TO RESTORE
* Need to ensure datasets are read-write after restoring
* Restores are either to the latest snapshot, or to a specific snapshot.
* Restores come into two categories:
  * Full
  * Incremental
  Without a common snapshot, a full restore must be done.
  An incremental restore needs the name of the snapshot to be
  restored, and the most recent previous common snapshot.
* Subclasses have to be able to override the starting snapshot.
* Prototype:
  ZFSBackup.restore(self, snapshot_name=None, force_full=False,
  			  start=None)
  * If start is specified, use that as the starting snapshot.
  * If snapshot_name is specified, use that as the snapshot to
    restore to.  If snapshot_name=None, then restore to the
    latest snapshot.

HOW TO VERIFY
* ZFS:  nothing to do.
* ZFS-over-SSH:  Verify datasets exist?
* Directory:  ensure all listed chunk files exist.
* S3:  Same as Directory, plus clear up any incomplete multipart uploads
